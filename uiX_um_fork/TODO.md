Shit that needs to be done:

* Fix the Muted button
* Fix the loop markers and the playhead
* Redesign the import button - its 20x20, while it should be done in 16x16
* Convert the whole thing to work with the master branch 
* Design missing icons for the master branch - Flip automation and duplicate BB 
* Add more colors, too gray now
* Fix knob1.png
* Redesign the stepper
* Redesign the combo-box
* Redesign the oscilloscope

A bit unrelated but:

* Make LMMS use a defined gradient for the main toolbar instead of a pixmap
